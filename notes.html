                        <h2>Startups vs. Big Tech</h2>
                        <h3>Startups</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Multifaceted Roles:</strong> In a startup, you'll likely wear many hats. Because startups typically have smaller teams, you might be involved in a broader set of activities than just product management. This can provide a holistic understanding of business operations and potentially broaden your skill set.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Rapid Learning:</strong> The pace at startups can be incredibly fast, providing opportunities for rapid learning. You'll need to be agile and adaptable as strategies may need to shift frequently.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Impact:</strong> Your contribution in a startup can be very visible and directly impactful. Decisions you make can significantly influence the product and company direction.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Risk and Reward:</strong> Startups can be risky—many fail. However, the potential rewards (financial and otherwise) if the startup succeeds can be substantial.
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Big Tech</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Specialization:</strong> In Big Tech companies, roles are typically more defined and specialized. You'll likely focus more deeply on product management and have a clear set of responsibilities.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Structured Learning:</strong> Big Tech companies often provide structured training and development programs, which can be beneficial for your professional growth. You'll also be working with experienced colleagues from whom you can learn.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Resources:</strong> In Big Tech companies, you'll typically have access to specialized resources that can greatly aid in your work. This includes dedicated design and data teams who can assist in the creation, analysis, and improvement of your product.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Stability:</strong> While no company is immune to failure, Big Tech companies typically offer more stability and predictability. Salary, benefits, and career progression paths are often more established and consistent.
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                      
                        <h2>How to break into your first PM role?</h2>
                        <ol>
                          <li><strong>(easier)</strong> Choose a company you are passionate about. Rather than immediately focusing on the role, optimize for the company, leadership, and mission — and then start your pivot into the role you really want. Coffee chats, mentors, projects. It’s always easier to do an internal transition than applying to be a new PM at a new company.</li>
                          <li><strong>(medium)</strong> Apply for an APM, product operations, product analyst role at a startup.</li>
                          <li><strong>(harder)</strong> Get accepted into a big tech rotational program. The holy grail! Getting accepted into one of these sets you up for the rest of your PM career. Challenging interview process.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Interviewing and Interview frameworks</h2>
                        <p>PM interviews are hard! They’re a mix of interpersonal skills (do I like this person?), product skills (does this person have a good, intuitive product sense?), and technical/analytical ability (is this person data-driven and uses data to solve problems?).</p>
                        <p>A big reason the PM interview is so challenging is because the questions asked are very broad. The focus and goal of many of these interviews is to assess how well you can break down complex problems into component pieces and think on your feet. Because of this, it’s important you learn some basic product management frameworks to help you organize your thoughts and approach.</p>
                        <p>The best resource I have found is <a href="https://stellarpeers.com/">Stellar Peers</a>. There are paid features to the site, but you should be able to get by reading the basic frameworks. One question you will almost surely get is to name your favorite product. What do you like about it? What would you improve? Preparing for this question is a good starting point to help you understand PM frameworks and what types of things interviewers are looking for.</p>

                        <p>The classic book that many recommend is <em>Cracking the PM Interview</em>, however I find this material outdated and not relevant to how PM interviews are conducted (in my experience). If you are looking for a book, I’d recommend <em>The Product Manager Interview</em> by Lewis C. Lin. This is good if you want to interview in Big Tech.</p>
