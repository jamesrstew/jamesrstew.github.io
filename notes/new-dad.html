                                        <li><strong>Meaning: </strong>Becoming a dad is easily the most meaningful event
                                            of my life - nothing else comes close. Not buying a dog. Not buying a house.
                                            Not even getting married. When people say “my pride and joy,” I used to
                                            think they were just being sentimental. Now I get it.<br /><br />What no one
                                            tells you is how peaceful babies can be. If your only exposure to infants is
                                            on airplanes or in crowded restaurants, you think they’re always screaming.
                                            But in reality, there are beautiful, sweet moments - late-night feedings,
                                            early-morning stretches, the weight of his small head resting in my arm.
                                            These moments aren’t loud or dramatic. But they stick with you. They change
                                            you.<br /></li>

                                        <li><strong>Community: </strong>One of the strange things about becoming a
                                            parent is realizing you&#x27;re suddenly part of a club - one you didn’t
                                            apply for and didn’t even notice before. But now you&#x27;re in, and the
                                            other members find you. A nod from a dad at the park. The subtle smirk from
                                            the cashier when your baby’s wailing at checkout. Stories from friends you
                                            haven’t heard from in years, now reaching out with advice or commiseration.

                                            Everything takes longer. Things you used to do without thinking - grabbing
                                            coffee, folding laundry, going for a run - now require coordination,
                                            negotiation, and sometimes just giving up. You have less time, less energy,
                                            and a lot less flexibility. So you have to prioritize like your life depends
                                            on it. Because sometimes it does.</li>

                                            the whole protocol: early morning sunlight, zero microplastics, daily
                                            breathwork, etc. But I&#x27;ve had to relax significantly since Dex arrived.
                                            Good luck avoiding plastic when most breast pumps and baby bottles are made
                                            from it, even the “glass” ones. Sanitizing often means microwaving plastic,
                                            which used to be sacrilege in my household. I&#x27;ve had to let go. You
                                            either adapt, or you suffer. Sometimes both :)</li>

                                            everyone wants your money. The number of paid apps you’re expected to adopt
                                            skyrockets, despite any resistance. The baby monitor (we skipped the Nanit
                                            because it requires a plan). The sound machine. The nightlight. The sleep
                                            tracking app. If it plugs in, it probably has a monthly fee. So we’ve
                                            defaulted to buying the “dumb” version of everything. No wifi, no app, no
                                            notifications. Just on/off. Simpler is better when you&#x27;re tired and
