                            fundamentally, as a person, I&#x27;ve come to realize that I hold certain principles.
                            Truths about life,
                            working effectively in the workplace, and building products. Like most others, I hold
                            these
                            subconsciously most of the time. Every so often, I’ll find myself in a situation and
                            these principles
                            will re-surface themselves in my mind. This essay is my attempt to articulate these
                            principles,
                            exploring their importance and their personal significance to me.</p>

                        <p id="950462f2-edc0-4c6e-9d6c-c434ee5ffb17" class="">In every team, company, or
                            organization, conflict is a
                            natural part of working together. When faced with conflict, we typically encounter two
                            paths: seeking
                            compromise or seeking truth. Opting for compromise is often the path of least
                            resistance. Jeff Bezos
                            illustrates this: “<em>Take you back in time 10,000 years, and you&#x27;re in a small
                                village. If you go
                                along to get along, you can survive, you can procreate.</em>” He goes on, “<em>If
                                you are the
                                village truth-teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the
                                night.</em>” This
                            exemplifies the inherent challenge in truth-telling – it&#x27;s against our natural
                            instincts for
                            harmony and survival. Yet, embracing truth is crucial in creating a culture of openness
                            and integrity
                            within the teams I lead. It&#x27;s about facing reality head-on, not shying away from it
                            or reshaping it
                            to fit our desires. I firmly believe that confronting the truth, despite its
                            difficulties, is
                            fundamental to achieving meaningful progress and building genuine, dynamic team
                            relationships.</p>

                            decision-making. If you are
                            ever met with a high-stakes decision — be it personal, professional, or otherwise — ask
                            yourself: is
                            this a “HELL YEAH!”? If there&#x27;s any hesitation that stops it from being a
                            resounding yes, then
                            it&#x27;s a no. This approach is like the Net Promoter Score (NPS) used for products,
                            where only those
                            consistently rated 9 or above are truly considered exceptional. By applying this
                            &#x27;Hell Yeah!&#x27;
                            framework, I ensure that my efforts are dedicated to pursuits that genuinely matter and
                            resonate with
                            me. It helps me maintain a laser focus, leading to a more meaningful and satisfying
                            life. This is my

                            profound truth about the human experience. In product management, there is always a long
                            list of
                            priorities and people competing for your attention. It&#x27;s easy to get lost in small
                            details or side
                            issues. This principle reminds me to concentrate on the most important tasks that really
                            move our
                            product forward. It means doing the essential work, even if it&#x27;s not the most
                            exciting or visible.
                            For me, it&#x27;s about not getting distracted by minor things and staying on track with
                            our main goals.
                            Every day, I try to focus on what will make the biggest difference for our product, just
                            like chopping
                            wood and carrying water are basic but vital tasks.</p>

                            the mindset I aspire to in work and life. It&#x27;s about setting audacious goals, taking

                            grit required to attempt great things. This quote drives me to take that first step and pour
