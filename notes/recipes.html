                        <h2 id="pancakes">The Best Pancakes</h2>

                        <p><em>Adapted from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joseybakerbread/?hl=en"
                                    target="_blank">@joseybakerbread on Instagram</a>, September 24, 2022.</em></p>

                        <p>For the fluffiest pancakes, Baker soaks his flour in milk overnight in the refrigerator, then
                            mixes up the batter in the morning. But don't worry if you forget or haven't planned ahead;
                            these pancakes are great even if you skip that step. Baker gives the option of adding a
                            tablespoon of sourdough starter to the mix, if you've been nursing one along.</p>

                        <h3>Serves 4</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
                            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon sourdough starter (optional!)</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for buttering the pan and serving</li>
                            <li>1 large egg</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                            <li>1½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                            <li>1½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>Chocolate chips, peanut butter, fresh fruit or maple syrup, for serving</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                        <p>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, milk and sourdough starter, if using. Cover and
                            refrigerate overnight, if desired. Stir in the sugar, butter, egg, baking soda, salt and
                            vanilla and mix until combined; don't worry about overmixing.</p>

                        <p>Melt some butter on a griddle or in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Ladle some batter
                            onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like; the batter will be thick, so
                            you may need to use the back of a spoon to help spread the batter. If you're planning to add
                            chocolate chips (or berries), do it now. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and
                            bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.</p>

                        <p>Cook on the second side until lightly browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes more.
                            Transfer to a plate and top as you like.</p>

                        <h3>Note (from original post):</h3>
                        <p>This recipe omits the overnight soak of the flour, as I have previously instructed in my
                            pancake recipes. I will admit that the overnight soak does in fact yield a slightly better
                            pancake, but I mean wtf we are already dirtying THREE bowls with this recipe, so I didn't
                            dare to ALSO ask you to start this recipe the day before for fear of being labeled a
                            MONSTER. But if you wanna go ALL THE WAY with your pancakes, then please soak your flour and
                            milk overnight and proceed with the rest of the recipe as described here. Or really, if you
                            wanna be THE MASTER OF PANCAKES you should also include some sourdough in your overnight
                            soak. But this might cause you to become known all over the land as the Master of Pancakes,
                            in which case you'd have to quit your day job and just make pancakes for everyone you know
                            for the rest of your days. So proceed with caution and don't say I didn't warn you.</p>

                        <h2 id="pita">James' Pita Bread</h2>

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>100g discard sourdough starter (about 1/2 cup, optional)</li>
                            <li>500g bread flour (about 4 cups)</li>
                            <li>4-5g baking soda (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
                            <li>15g olive oil (about 1 tablespoon), plus more for cooking if needed</li>
                            <li>10g salt (about 1 and 3/4 teaspoons)</li>
                            <li>300ml water (about 1 and 1/4 cups)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Starter and Water Mixture (Optional)</h3>
                        <p>If available, combine the discard sourdough starter and water in a large mixing bowl. Stir
                            well to mix. The starter is optional and is used to enhance the flavor of the pita.</p>

                        <h3>Adding Dry Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>Gradually add the bread flour to the water, stirring continuously. Sprinkle in the baking
                            soda and salt. Drizzle in the 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until all ingredients are
                            combined.</p>

                        <h3>Stretch and Fold</h3>
                        <p>With the dough in the bowl, grab one side of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it
                            over itself. Rotate the bowl slightly and repeat about 2-3 times. Let the dough rest for 30
                            minutes and repeat this process a few times over 2 hours.</p>

                        <h3>First Rise</h3>
                        <p>After the final set of stretch and folds, cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.
                            Allow the dough to rise in a warm place until it almost doubles in size, which should take
                            about 1 to 2 hours.</p>

                        <h3>Shaping the Pitas</h3>
                        <p>Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it. Divide the dough into small balls, around 8-10,
                            depending on your preferred pita size. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin or a
                            tortilla press (if available) to flatten each ball into a round, flat shape, about 1/4 inch
                            thick. Be careful not to press too hard to maintain some airiness in the dough. Cover the
                            dough balls with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes, or up to
                            overnight.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking on Cast Iron Skillet</h3>
                        <p>Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. If the pitas start to stick, lightly brush
                            the skillet with olive or avocado oil. Place a rolled-out pita onto the skillet. Cook for
                            2-4 minutes until it puffs up and the bottom has browned. Flip and cook the other side for
                            an additional 2-4 minutes.</p>

                        <h3>Cooling and Storing</h3>
                        <p>Remove the cooked pita from the skillet and cover it with a clean towel to keep it soft.
                            Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve the pitas warm, or store them in an airtight
                            container after they’ve cooled down.</p>
