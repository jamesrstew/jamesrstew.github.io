                                    2025</em></p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80dc-9985-fd192fd765fc" class="">For much of my career, I
                                worked at small startups. Recently, I joined a big company. I didn't expect it
                                to change how I think about work, but it has.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8037-b4f0-f339c2bb0b10" class="">At startups you have a kind of
                                freedom that's almost impossible to replicate anywhere else. It comes from
                                necessity. There isn't a "mobile platform team," a "data pipeline team," a
                                "launch readiness gate," or a "brand team". There's just you, and whoever's
                                sitting next to you, trying to figure out how to get people to use the thing you
                                built. Nobody asks you for permission because there's no one to ask. You decide
                                what matters, you decide when it ships, and you live with whatever happens.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80c2-a47d-e73ad08af7b0" class="">You aren't managing scope,
                                you're managing survival.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80af-b8e3-d196960c746c" class="">The strange part is that this
                                freedom doesn't necessarily lead to large results. You could have a strong
                                insight, work incredibly hard, and still launch something to six users. If two
                                of them don't like it, there goes 30% of your active user base. Startups are
                                exciting largely because the variance is so high. You could build something that
                                nobody cares about. You could also build something that changes the world. These
                                possibilities sit right next to each other, and you feel that every day.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8048-a69a-da1d2c89e627" class="">Big companies are different.
                                You don't own the whole product anymore. You own a part of it - a slice, a
                                pixel. But that pixel will be seen by millions of people. Sometimes millions in
                                a single afternoon. There's something humbling about that. At startups I could
                                change everything, but those changes affected only a few people. At a big
                                company I change almost nothing, but when it moves, it moves the needle.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8001-9e90-dba8c08ccdd7" class="">You trade autonomy for scale.
                            </p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80ee-afd8-f6002d5caa25" class="">I used to think the trade
                                wasn't worth it. Now I'm not so sure.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-804e-abca-fda5491a6062" class="">Another difference is the
                                distribution of outcomes. In startups, you can fail spectacularly. I've seen
                                entire companies disappear overnight because one number on a fundraising slide
                                didn't go the right direction. I've also seen products go from zero to ten
                                thousand users in a weekend. It's emotionally violent. You spend a lot of time
                                oscillating between delusion and despair.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80b4-a058-fc9ac8476477" class="">At a big company, the highs
                                and lows are capped. You rarely launch something that is catastrophic or
                                transcendent. Most things fall somewhere between "pretty good" and "not so
                                good." That can feel limiting, but it also means your career becomes less of a
                                gamble. Your resume gets better even if the product doesn't change the world.
                            </p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-808d-abec-c014c66f0040" class="">The same ceiling applies to
                                people.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80ce-8617-d73ebaf90066" class="">At startups, you encounter
                                some of the best engineers you'll ever meet. They move effortlessly between
                                architecture, design, and product thinking. They don't ask "what do you want?"
                                They ask "why does it matter?" Some of them think so far ahead that you feel
                                like you're watching someone 4D play chess.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8041-aead-cd6274e145c0" class="">You also encounter the worst
                                engineers you'll ever meet. People who couldn't get a job anywhere else, who are
                                willing to exchange stability for equity that may never exist. Startups compress
                                the talent curve. You get the brilliant and the hopeless. Very little in the
                                middle.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-804f-90e0-c739c0c49b01" class="">Big companies have a higher
                                floor. Fewer geniuses, fewer disasters. You don't see as many miracles, but you
                                also don't see as many train wrecks.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80b8-946d-e84b572641ce" class="">After enough time in startups,
                                you develop a strange instinct. You start to recognize who is adding value and
                                who isn't. It's not emotional - more like a survival reflex. When you've lived
                                through enough layoffs, you start to see people the way a founder might: if the
                                company had to shrink to five people tomorrow, who would still be here?</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8070-8524-ebbe5cbe0000" class="">That awareness makes you
                                sharper, but also more savage. Startups reward urgency, intensity, and optimization.
                                Big companies reward alignment, collaboration, and patience. Both value
                                creation, but they operate in different timescales. Startups are about
                                combustion. Big companies are about inertia.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-8013-bd12-ea2525eb51e9" class="">If there's anything I've
                                learned from stepping from one world into the other, it's that neither
                                environment has a monopoly on meaning. Startups teach you to build from zero.
                                Big companies teach you to build for scale. If you're lucky, you learn both.</p>
                            <p id="2a87a536-f307-80d3-ae2c-da4ae93bde8d" class="">Startups give you the steering
