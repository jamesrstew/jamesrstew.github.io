                                Interview</em>,
                            however I find this material outdated and not relevant to how PM interviews are conducted
                            (in my
                            experience). If you are looking for a book, I’d recommend <em>The Product Manager Interview
                            </em>by
                            Lewis C. Lin. This is good if you want to interview in Big Tech.
